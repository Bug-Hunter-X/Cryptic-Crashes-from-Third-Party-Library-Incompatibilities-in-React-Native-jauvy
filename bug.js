This error occurs when you are using a third-party library that is not compatible with your React Native version or has some internal inconsistencies.  The error message itself might not pinpoint the exact location within the library, making debugging challenging.  Often, the error manifests as seemingly unrelated issues within your own code, such as unexpected behavior or crashes without clear stack traces related to your application logic.

Example: Imagine a library called `react-native-fancy-button` that has a bug causing it to crash randomly.  Your app uses this button, and the crash is not directly tied to your code's interaction with the button, leading to confusion during debugging.  The error log might be full of native module errors without clear guidance.
