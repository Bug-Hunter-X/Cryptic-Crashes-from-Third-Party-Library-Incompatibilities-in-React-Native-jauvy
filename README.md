# Cryptic Crashes from Third-Party Library Incompatibilities in React Native

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a React Native app crashes due to incompatibility with a third-party library. The crash is not directly traceable to the app's code, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

The issue arises from using a hypothetical library, `react-native-fancy-button`, which has an internal inconsistency or incompatibility with the current React Native version.  The app crashes randomly without direct stack traces pointing to our code. The error logs mostly show native module errors, masking the real cause.

## Solution

The solution involves either updating the third-party library to a compatible version, downgrading the React Native version if necessary, or using an alternative library with better compatibility and stability.
