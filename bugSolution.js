Debugging this type of issue requires a systematic approach:

1. **Isolate the Library:**  Comment out parts of your code to see if you can narrow down the problem to a specific library. 
2. **Check Library Versions:** Ensure the problematic third-party library is compatible with your React Native version and other dependencies.  Check the library's documentation and GitHub issues for any known problems.
3. **Update/Downgrade:** Try updating the library to the latest version. If that doesn't work, try downgrading to an earlier version known to be stable. 
4. **Alternative Library:** If the problem persists, consider switching to a different library that offers similar functionality with better compatibility and stability.
5. **Check Native Modules:**  Examine the native module logs closely. Sometimes, clues might be hidden in the native code error messages, providing hints about the underlying issue.
6. **Clean and Rebuild:**  A clean build can sometimes resolve mysterious issues. Delete your `node_modules` folder and re-install dependencies.

// Example (bug.js):

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import FancyButton from 'react-native-fancy-button'; // Hypothetical problematic library

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>My App</Text>
      <FancyButton title="Click Me" onPress={() => {}} />
    </View>
  );
}

// Example (bugSolution.js - assuming an alternative library)

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import SimpleButton from 'react-native-simple-button'; // Alternative library

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>My App</Text>
      <SimpleButton title="Click Me" onPress={() => {}} />
    </View>
  );
}
